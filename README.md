# Composer-5-Support-Files

Support files compatible with MultiMarkdown Composer 5 and nvUltra:

*	CSS - CSS files useful for the preview function in Composer and nvUltra. 
	These are "standard" CSS files, and are not specifically designed for these
	apps, but are generally optimized in a couple of small ways to work with
	HTML generated by MultiMarkdown.  Most are created by Brett Terpstra.

*	Dictionaries - Plain text files with one entry per line.  Used for
	autocompletion support in Composer v4+, as well as nvUltra.

*	Expansions - JSON files that match keys with expansions.  Typing the
	shortcut instructs the editor to replace it with the expansion.  There are
	some powerful features that can be combined in interesting ways.  More
	information is
	[here](http://support.multimarkdown.com/kb/composer-v4/multimarkdown-composer-v4-expansions).

*	Themes - JSON files to specify syntax highlighting for the editor.  These
	are basically the same as those used in MultiMarkdown Composer v4, but with
	a few slight changes.  The goal is for nvUltra and Composer 5 files to be
	compatible, but Composer 5 is still in development. More information is
	[here](http://support.multimarkdown.com/kb/composer-v4/multimarkdown-composer-v4-themes).
